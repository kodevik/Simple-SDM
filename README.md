Based on the method explained in [Xiong and De la Torre, 2013](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/2013/5/main.pdf). A simple implementation of the supervised descent method (SDM) using NumPy and OpenCV in Python. Many other implementations may be found but this is a simple, stripped back implementation made with the intention of explaining the core concept behind SDM.

The dataset used for this project is a subset of that provided by Boris Katsnelson [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/boriskatsnelson/facialkeypointdetection/data).
